# Server on LAN
A simple mod to advertise the given server on a LAN network, in addition to the normal methods of connection.
Useful for LAN parties or just decluttering your server menu.
- Only runs on the server
- Confirmed to run on 1.17.1, though I wager running on other versions would be simple.

### Known issue
- Multi line MOTDs are not respected. This can't be fixed as it's a client issue.
